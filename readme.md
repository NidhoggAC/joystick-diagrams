## What is this tool for?
Learning flight simulators is a daunting task, with lots of buttons to remember. I built this tool for myself, and then thought others might also enjoy it, automating what is a time consuming task!

- Export your joystick/throttle/custom HID buttons to a SVG, and print with your browser
- Overlay your buttons onto an actual Joystick profile/picture
- Learn your joystick setup easier and be a better pilot!

## What it's do?

### General
- Custom SVG templates can be built to suit your joystick, throttle, custom HID device
- Diagram style only limited by your design skills! :)

### Joystick Gremlin
- Importing/inheriance of base templates into button profile exports
- Support for multiple profiles in Joystick Gremlin

### DCS World
- Export any of your plane/helicopter configurations to diagram
- Select which profiles you want to export

## What's it not do?
