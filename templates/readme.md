# Templates
A lot of the templates included with Joystick Diagrams are brand new, created by myself for the tool. Some have kindly been supplied by the community!

# Default Templates

## Virpil
These are iniital releases, and may require tweaking. Virpil are highly customisable and as such "Button_1" for one person may be "Button_2" for another

### Adding/Modifying Templates
There are many joysticks out there, and a template needs to be provided for them in /Templates.

This is very easy to do, for free online

1. Go to an SVG compliant editor (http://draw.io/) and open Custom/BaseTemplate_X.SVG
2. Create a joystick profile by importing a joystick image, and creating labels
3. Call the label BUTTON_X, where X is the actual physical button on your stick
4. Export template as SVG
5. Place this in /Templates with the exact device name seen by windows

If you have created a template, happy to include it back in the repository.
